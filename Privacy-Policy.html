    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Controller</h2>
        <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Brahim Largou</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:largou.digital@gmail.com">largou.digital@gmail.com</a></p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The app “Baby Face AI Generator” collects and processes the following data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Uploaded photos (including photos that may contain faces) are used for AI processing to generate a baby image.</li>
            <li><strong>App usage data:</strong> Anonymous usage statistics (for example, which features are used, crash reports) to improve the app and ensure stability. We do not collect this data for the purpose of personally identifying individual users.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2.1 Face Photos and Face Data</h2>
        <p>When you upload a photo that may contain your face or the face of another person, we use this image solely to generate an AI-created baby image for you.</p>
        <p>We do not perform facial recognition and do not attempt to identify you or any other person in the image or to verify your identity.</p>
        <p>We do not use your photos or face data for authentication, identity verification, advertising, profiling, or training our own machine learning models. We do not sell your face data.</p>
        <p>To provide the baby image generation feature, your photo is processed by our technical service provider <strong>Replicate</strong> (the “Processor”) acting as our data processor. The photo is transmitted securely and processed on the Processor’s servers only to generate the requested baby image and to maintain the reliability and security of the service. The Processor is contractually obligated to protect the data with appropriate security measures and to delete it after a limited retention period required for processing and system reliability.</p>
        <p>We retain your original photo only for as long as is necessary to generate and display the baby image to you and to maintain the short-term reliability and security of our services. After this period, the image is deleted or irreversibly anonymized. We do not link your face photo to any account or identifier that would allow us or our Processor to identify you personally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p><strong>Replicate API:</strong> Used for AI processing of uploaded photos in order to generate the baby image. Photos are processed only for the technically necessary period and are not stored permanently.</p>
        <p><strong>Firebase:</strong> Used for Remote Config and Analytics. Data is collected only to improve the app and its stability. It is not collected for the purpose of personally identifying individual users.</p>
        <p><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used to display advertisements. Google’s privacy policy applies. Depending on your device settings, anonymized advertising IDs may be used.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All baby images generated by the app are stored locally on your device if you choose to save them. We do not permanently store your photos on our own servers.</p>
        <p>Processing by third-party providers (such as Replicate) only takes place for the period required to generate the baby image and to maintain technical reliability and security. After this period, the data is deleted or anonymized according to the provider’s policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request access to, rectification or deletion of your personal data, as well as the right to object to certain processing activities, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about your data or wish to exercise your rights, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:largou.digital@gmail.com">largou.digital@gmail.com</a></p>
